# Auto Encoded Neural Network in C++

This repository contains an implementation of an Auto Encoded Neural Network (ANN) using C++. The project is currently under development and is subject to frequent changes. There are known bugs, errors, and missing features that are actively being worked on.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:
AutoEncodedNeuralNetwork/

│   ├── Layer.cpp
│   ├── Layer.hpp
│   ├── Matrix.cpp
│   ├── Matrix.hpp
│   ├── Neuron.cpp

│   └── main.cpp
├── assets/
│   └── README.md


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- CMake (optional, for easier project setup)

### Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
g++ main.cpp Layer.cpp Matrix.cpp Neuron.cpp NN.cpp -o autoencoded_nn
./autoencoded_nn
```

### Usage

The `main.cpp` file contains an example of how to initialize and train the neural network. You can modify the `topology`, `learningRate`, and other parameters to experiment with different configurations.

### Known Issues

- **Segmentation Faults**: The program may encounter segmentation faults due to improper memory management. This is currently being addressed.
- **Backpropagation Errors**: The backpropagation algorithm needs further refinement to ensure accurate weight updates.
- **Missing Features**: Some features such as saving and loading the trained model, more activation functions, and regularization techniques are yet to be implemented.
